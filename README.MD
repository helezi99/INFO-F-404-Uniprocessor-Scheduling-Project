# INFO-F-404: Real-Time Operating Systems  
## Uniprocessor Scheduling Project

This project is part of the Real-Time Operating Systems course at the Department of Computer Science, Facult√© des Sciences. The goal is to simulate uniprocessor scheduling for synchronous task sets with constrained deadlines using three priority assignment algorithms: Deadline Monotonic (DM), Earliest Deadline First (EDF), and Round Robin (RR). The project also includes a report comparing the performance of these algorithms.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

### Command-line Arguments

To run the scheduler, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py <algorithm> <taskset_file> [-v]
