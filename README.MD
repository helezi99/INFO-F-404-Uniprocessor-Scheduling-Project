This project is part of the Real-Time Operating Systems course at the Department of Computer Science, Facult√© des Sciences. The goal is to simulate uniprocessor scheduling for synchronous task sets with constrained deadlines using three priority assignment algorithms: Deadline Monotonic (DM), Earliest Deadline First (EDF), and Round Robin (RR). The project also includes a report comparing the performance of these algorithms.
